# PythonMiniProject
* People use GitHub on a daily basis, a place to store code with all the revision history they need.
* Git specifically works by taking snapshots of files, if files remains unchanged in a particular version, it simply links to the 
  previous files. This keeps everything fast and lean.  
* In our project also, we have implemented Git like structure.  
* The user has a directory with the options of adding, deleting, viewing and editing files. 
* They can branch out at anytime, preserving the previous state in such a way that it can be accessed and modified when needed. 
* To achieve this we are using Persistent Binary Search Trees.
